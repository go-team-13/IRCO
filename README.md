# IRCODEX

## Description
We created a map view with Angular, allowing users to access schools and programs by clicking pins in the map. It enables community users who may have language barriers to interact with the website. 

To support this user interface, we created the back-end with Django. The database stores all SUN school and program information such as school names, address, contact. It supports administrators to manage school and program information in a structured and dynamic environment

## Running the app locally
### Prerequisites
Before running the app, make sure that you have `npm` and `Node.js` version 8.x or 10.x installed.

Install the Angular CLI by running the following command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Clone or download this repo and navigate to `irco-app`.

Install necessary dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

Finally, start up a local instance of the app by running the following command:

`ng serve --open`

## To-do
* Connect front-end with back-end, so that the web app is dynamic
* Add translation functionality that allows users to switch to another language
* Add search functionality that allows users to search by activity/location/availability etc.
* Add pictures of school sites and activities
